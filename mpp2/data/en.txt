basin typically form between july and november the first tropical cyclone of the season tropical storm pabuk developed in late december the final typhoon phanfone dissipated on december a total of tropical depressions formed during the season of these developed into named tropical storms of which became severe tropical storms and became typhoons additionally five typhoons became super typhoonsan unofficial rank given by the united states joint typhoon warning center jtwc to storms with minute maximum sustained wind speed of at least kmh mph activity in the season was greater than normalnb primarily due to high sea surface temperatures el nio conditions persisted from late to the second quarter of in february typhoon wutip became the strongest recorded typhoon to occur during the month the conditions became neutral during the northern summer as strong activity occurred in the monsoon trough over southeast asia in august promoting tropical cyclogenesis in november activity

it is responsible for assigning names to all tropical cyclones that reach minute maximum sustained winds of at least kilometers per hour miles per hour in the region the pagasa assigns names to tropical cyclones that form or enter their area of responsibility as a tropical depression or stronger regardless if the cyclone has been assigned a name by the jma the jtwc also monitors systems in the western pacific basin assigning systems a number with a w suffix if the system is a tropical depression or stronger this timeline includes information from poststorm reviews by the jma and the jtwc as well as naming from the pagasa it documents tropical cyclone formations strengthening weakening landfalls extratropical transition and dissipations during the season reports among warning
